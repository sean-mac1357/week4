        <h1>You can write your thoughts here</h1>
        <h2>Or rant about whatever grinds your gears</h2>
        <h3>Like that Jeremy guy, for example</h3>
        <h4>I mean, like what is his deal?</h4>
        <h5>Why does he drink so much Coke Zero? Weird...</h5>
    <p>This exercise is about nesting div tags</p>
    <div>
        <p>This div contains this text and the div tag below</p>
        <div>
            <p>Hi, Im the div tag that was mentioned in my parent div! I contains
                this text and two other children divs</p>
            <div>
                <p> Hi! our parent was just talking about us. Please make sure you indent
                this example appropriately.</p>

        <p>This exercise is about making lists</p>
        <p>Here's what I like about this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
            <li>That's about it</li>
            <li>I'm gonna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you make a list, do it in this order:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
            <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
            <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
            </ol>
        </ol>

        <ul>
            <li>If you want to sound normal, just use a regular li tag here</li>
            <li><em>If you want to sound interesting, try the italics tag</em></li>
            <li><strong>If you want to sound annoying, try the bold tag</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>You did it! You should be proud of yourself</p>
